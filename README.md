## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've become a bit more familiar with semantic HTML elements, but I still have more to learn. I styled lists and tables for the first time, and it took a while before I managed to achieve the style I wanted.

### Continued development

I want to structure my code a bit better; I feel it's still a bit too messy.
